# Analytics Engineering Mock Exams
Contains my answers to Analytics Engineering Mock Exams generated by Gemini AI to test the following skills:
1. **Advanced Analytics Engineering**
    - This exam goes beyond foundational skills to test your knowledge of data architecture, pipeline automation, and communication. It presents scenarios that an analytics engineer would encounter in a real-world production environment.
    - Contains the following:
      - Data Modeling & Warehousing
      - Pipeline Orchestration & Automation
      - Software Engineering for data
      - Communication & Business Acumen 
2. **API Data Ingestion**
    - This exam is designed to test your ability to use Python to interact with APIs, handle different data formats, and transform the data into a usable structure for a data warehouse. This is a core skill for an analytics engineer who often needs to ingest data from third-party services.
    - Contains the following:
      - Data Extraction
      - Data Transformation & Modeling
      - Final Integration & Concepts 
3. **Intermediate to Advanced SQL with BigQuery**
    - Contains the following:
      - Customer Segmentation and RFM Analysis
      - Time Series Analysis with Window Functions
      - Complex Joins and Aggregation
      - Data Deduplication and CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
      - Handling Nested and Repeated Data
      - Working with Arrays
      - Subqueries and Date Manipulation
      - Geospatial Data and GEOGRAPHY Functions
      - Combining Multiple Datasets with `UNION ALL`
4. **Business Metrics**
     - This exam is designed to assess your skills in SQL, data modeling, and business problem-solving. The questions are based on common business domains and utilize publicly available BigQuery datasets. For each section, you are presented with a business problem and a series of tasks. You should write a single SQL query (or a set of queries if necessary) to answer all the questions in that section.
     - Contains the following:
       - E-commerce & Sales Analysis
       - Financial & Market Analysis
       - Data Quality & Performance Optimization
5. **Data Analysis**
      - Two Exams:
        1. Data Analysis with BigQuery and Power BI
           - This exam assesses your ability to perform data analysis in a cloud data warehouse and present your findings in a professional business intelligence tool. The exam is split into two sections: a hands-on BigQuery task and a conceptual Power BI dashboard design task.
           - Contains the following:
             - Data Analysis with BigQuery SQL
             - Reporting & Visualization with Power BI
        3. Data Analysis with Python
           - This exam is designed to assess your ability to use Python, particularly the pandas library, for data cleaning, analysis, and reporting. The questions are based on a common e-commerce business problem and will test your practical skills in a typical data analysis workflow.
           - Contains the following:
             - Data Ingestion & Cleaning
             - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
             - Advanced Analysis & Reporting
6. **dbt Modeling**
    - This exam assesses your ability to use dbt to transform raw data into a clean, well-structured, and reliable data warehouse. You will be provided with a series of tasks to build a simple data pipeline using a public BigQuery dataset. The focus is on best practices, data quality, and creating models that are easy to understand and use.
    - You may also find other sample dbt projects from the [dbt-analytics-projects](https://github.com/alyllanes/dbt-analytics-projects) repository
    - Contains the following:
      - Staging Models
      - Core Models
      - Data Marts
      - Data Quality & Documentation
7. **End-to-End Analytics Engineering**
   - This exam is the culmination of the skills we've discussed, designed to simulate a complete project lifecycle for an analytics engineer. The goal is to build a full data pipeline, from raw data ingestion to a final dashboard for a business user.
   - Contains the following:
     - Data Ingestion & Extraction using Python
     - Data Transformation & Modeling using dbt
     - Data Warehouse Architecture & Optimization using BigQuery
     - Dashboarding & Visualization using Power BI
